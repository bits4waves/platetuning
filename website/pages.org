The plate tuning process may get very tedious because of the difficulties at each step to know exactly where to carve so as to obtain the desired impact on the final frequency.

In a very interesting paper by Alan Carruth---a former student of Carleen Hutchins---the author gives a diagram with the impacts that carving might have on several different regions on the plate (1).

This information was compiled in a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1flQmmzBa5rORl6uWclfxSgB1eQOwRGLfKLvUKZurYr0/copy][spreadsheet]], where you can input the desired final frequencies for the plates, and then feed it with the current ones.
Based on this input, it will show diagrams with the regions that could be carved in order to achieve the final desired frequencies.
